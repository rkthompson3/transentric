        Agilink Event Manager is a shipment notification that works in combination with your
        tracking solution and captures shipping and event information in real-time. Status’ can
        be delivered via email or EDI or accessed through the Internet. Transentric provides a
        framework for dispatchers, drivers and transportation providers to give visibility of the
        shipment status to their customers based upon movement activity. EventManager can
        help eliminate the question "where is my shipment?"
